          Some children communicate best using supports beyond spoken words. AAC includes tools like picture boards, communication books, or speech-generating devices such as iPads with communication apps.

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            These systems provide children with a way to express themselves, connect with others, and build language skills, whether or not they are using spoken words. Research shows that introducing AAC early can actually support speech and language development — it does not hinder it. In fact, many children who begin using AAC go on to develop more spoken language.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Some children use AAC as their primary way to communicate, while others use it alongside spoken language. Every child's communication journey is unique.
