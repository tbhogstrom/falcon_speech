              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is a screening?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">A screening is a quick, informal check of your child's communication skills. It is not used to diagnose or determine if a delay or disorder is present. Instead, a screening helps identify whether a more in-depth evaluation is recommended.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is an evaluation?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">An evaluation is a comprehensive, formal assessment of your child's speech and/or language skills. The SLP may use standardized tests, parent interviews, clinical observations, and document reviews to develop a full picture of your child's communication strengths and needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is a therapy session?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">A therapy session is a focused time to work on your child's individual communication goals. The SLP will engage your child in fun, goal-oriented activities and may also collaborate with you to support your child's progress between sessions.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is hybrid therapy?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Hybrid therapy is a combination of teletherapy and in-person sessions. Some sessions take place over a secure telehealth platform, while others occur in person in your home. This model blends the convenience of virtual care with the hands-on support of face-to-face interaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Does hybrid therapy work?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Yes! Teletherapy has been shown to be just as effective as in-person therapy for many children. Hybrid therapy provides the added benefit of building a strong therapeutic relationship through occasional in-person visits, which can be especially helpful for younger children or those who need more support with engagement.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I choose teletherapy only?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">In some cases, yes. Older children who can participate independently may do well with teletherapy only. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis and depends on your child's needs, learning style, and therapy goals. If you are out of range for the in-person service area, you may select teletherapy only!</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I choose in-person therapy only?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">At this time, we are not offering in-person-only therapy. We hope to expand services in the future (including potential in-person only options in the Columbia River Gorge area), but currently all services follow a hybrid or teletherapy model.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can sessions take place somewhere other than my home?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, in some cases. Certain children may benefit from community-based sessions in places like libraries, parks, or quiet cafés. This is considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the child's goals, sensory needs, and safety.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2"><strong>Note:</strong> Kailey is licensed in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, so teletherapy sessions must occur in those states, ideally from your home or another private, quiet space.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do you accept insurance?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">We are a private-pay practice and do not bill insurance directly. This allows us to provide high-quality, personalized care without administrative limitations and time constraints.</p>

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is a superbill?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">A superbill is a detailed receipt that includes all the information your insurance company may require for you to submit an out-of-network reimbursement claim. This includes billing codes, session dates, provider credentials, and service descriptions.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-500"><strong>Note:</strong> Reimbursement is not guaranteed and depends on your specific plan and out-of-network benefits. It is your responsibility to check with your insurance provider regarding coverage and submission requirements.</p>
